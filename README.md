# QwenAgent-iNTErFaCe
Project Status: Alpha; under development. To produce, some awesome interface for the Qwen-Agent framework....

### Current Work
- Still to make the project complete working version, bug free and as intended.
- Investigating processing on, gpu and cpu, while load model on system ram.

## Description:
- Qwen-Agent is an agent framework, hence here is my drop in interface for Qwen-Agent. 

### Features:
- Pre-gradio interface for configuration of models through dynamic menu, before main.
- The project will be progrogrammed for, AMD/nVidia Gpu via Directml and Intel/Amd, support.
- The project will be optimized for 64GB ram and  hence developed on the model Qwen2-56B-6Bit-GGUF. 
- Code will be tailored towards technology level of AMD4/DirectX_12 level hardware.

### Preview:
- Standalone Configurator...
```
Config Main Menu

1. Model Options
(CurrentModel: None)
2. Processor Options
(CurrentProcessor: None)

----------------------
Selection; Choose Options = 1-2, Exit Program = X:
```

## Research:
- Are the new AMD optimized system files from AMD, able to be better taken advantage somehow in the scripts.
