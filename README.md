# QwenAgent-GradioInterfaces..
Alpha; under development. I will be producing, or attempting to produce, some interfaces for the Qwen-Agent framework...

## Current Work
- Researching and downloading of models.
- Single Model version will be developed first, context length is an issue, its 1 file, alike making an EA, hence, go with the simpler one first.
- Two Model version.

## Description:
- Qwen-Agent is an agent framework, hence, here will be some interfaces for that framework.

## Features:
- Single-Model Version intended for 1 large model (not created yet).
- Multi-Model version intended for multiple 7b models (incomplete).
- Two-Model version intended for, 1 57b model and 1 7b code model.
