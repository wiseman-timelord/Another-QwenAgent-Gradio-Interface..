# Qwen-Agent_INTErFaCe
Project Status: Alpha; under development. I will be producing, or attempting to produce, some awesome interface for the Qwen-Agent framework, that is...

## Current Work
- Complete working version, bug free and as intended.
- Investigating processing on, gpu and cpu, while load model on system ram.

## Description:
- Qwen-Agent is an agent framework, hence, here will be some interfaces for that framework. 
- The project will be progrogrammed for, AMD/nVidia Gpu via Directml and Intel/Amd, support.
- The project will be optimized for 64GB ram, hence developed on the model Qwen2-56B-6Bit-GGUF. 

## Features:
- Single-Model Version intended for 1 large model (incomplete).
- Multi-Model version intended for multiple 7b models  (needs testing, bugfix, improvement).
- Two-Model version intended for, 1 57b model and 1 7b code model (incomplete).

## Research:
- Are the new AMD optimized system files from AMD, able to be better taken advantage somehow in the scripts.
